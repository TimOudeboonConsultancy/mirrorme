# Coding Guidelines for Assistance

## Code Organization

- All files should use region markers to organize code into logical blocks
- Format for regions:
  ```javascript
  // #region DESCRIPTIVE_NAME
  function someFunction() {
    // implementation
  }
  // #endregion DESCRIPTIVE_NAME
  ```

## Assistance Rules

When suggesting code changes:
1. Refer to specific regions by their name, e.g., "Replace the CARD_UPDATE region with this:"
2. Provide complete code for the region being replaced
3. For complex changes across multiple files, specify exactly which region in which file to modify
4. Use diff notation when appropriate for small changes:
   ```diff
   - const oldCode = something();
   + const newCode = somethingBetter();
   ```
5. Always explain the purpose of the changes

## Naming Conventions for Regions

- Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for region names
- Name regions based on their logical function, not implementation details
- Keep names concise but descriptive

## Benefits of Using Regions

- Easier navigation in IDEs like WebStorm that support code folding
- Clear boundaries for code replacement during updates
- Self-documenting code structure
- Reduced context needed when discussing specific parts of the codebase

## Example Region Names

- API_RETRY
- CARD_CREATION
- EVENT_HANDLERS
- INITIALIZATION
- AUTHENTICATION
- DATA_PROCESSING
- ERROR_HANDLING
- UTILITIES
- VALIDATION
- SYNCHRONIZATION

## File Organization Tips

- Group related functionality into the same file
- Consider breaking very large files (>500 lines) into multiple smaller files
- Use a consistent order for regions (e.g., initialization first, helpers last)
- For class-based files, keep the constructor in a CLASS_DEFINITION region at the top

## Updating Guidelines

- When adding new code, always place it within an appropriate region
- Create new regions when adding significantly different functionality
- Keep region sizes reasonable (ideally <100 lines each)
- Ensure region names accurately reflect their current purpose as code evolves
